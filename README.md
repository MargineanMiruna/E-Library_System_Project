# E-Library System Project
üìù Project Overview:
The E-Library Management System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to manage library operations efficiently. It supports multiple roles‚ÄîAdmins, Librarians, and Customers‚Äîallowing users to borrow books, submit reviews, manage library resources, and track loans seamlessly. This system promotes a flexible, scalable architecture suitable for both physical and digital libraries.

üöÄ Key Features:
1. User Management:

  Admin: Manages libraries, adds or updates library information, and oversees library operations.
  Librarian: Handles book inventory, including adding and updating book details within assigned libraries.
  Customer: Can create memberships, borrow and return books, and leave reviews for both books and libraries.

2. Library Management:

  Stores information like name, address, contact details, and ratings.
  Supports multiple librarians managing books within the same library.

3. Book Management:

  Books have detailed attributes such as title, authors, ISBN, cover image, availability status, and ratings.
  Books belong to a specific library and can receive multiple customer reviews.

4. Loan System:

  Customers can borrow books, with each loan tracking issue and due dates, status, and linked customer/book information.
  QR codes can be generated for book receiving and returning.

5. Review System:

  A flexible review model allows customers to review both books and libraries.
  Each review includes ratings, comments, and timestamps, impacting the overall rating of the book/library.
